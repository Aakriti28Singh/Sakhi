# Sakhi 🩷

**Sakhi** is a compassionate web platform built to support survivors of sexual assault and rape. It provides a safe, accessible space where victims can find verified NGOs, trusted support organizations, and resources for assistance, legal help, and emotional recovery.

The project aims to bridge the gap between survivors and trustworthy support systems by making it easier to discover, connect with, and reach out to NGOs. It features a secure login system for both users and NGO administrators, an approval workflow to ensure that only genuine organizations are listed, and an intuitive dashboard to manage NGO information.
